                    In July 1909, a son was born into the Akindayomi family of Ondo State of Nigeria. Even though this child
                    grew up surrounded by idol worshippers, he knew there existed a greater power and yearned to know,

                    “The God who created the earth and everyone on it”. This pursuit for God led him to the Church
                    Missionary
                    Society where he was baptized in 1927. Still spiritually unfulfilled, he joined the Cherubim and
                    Seraphim
                    church in 1931.

                    Whilst there, he began to hear a voice within him saying, “You will be my servant.” Since this was not
                    his
                    intention, he decided to ignore the voice. This went on for seven years during which all the business
                    ventures that he tried resulted into failure. In debt and without peace of mind, he found himself
                    totally
                    dependent on the grace of God. Here marked the beginning of a definite relationship with God.Totally
                    broken,
                    he yielded saying, “Lord, I will go wherever you want me to go.” He asked for signs to confirm that this
                    was
                    indeed God’s call. The confirmation came through the Bible passages of Jeremiah 1:4-10, Isaiah 41:10-13
                    and
                    Romans 8:29-31. The Lord assured him that He would provide for all his needs, as he would not receive
                    any
                    salary from that point on. This proved to be a comforting reminder during the trials in the months
                    ahead. He
                    became married in 1941. He continued to worship with the Cherubim and Seraphim. In 1947, he started to
                    become concerned that the church was departing from the true Word of God in some of its practices. By
                    1952,
                    he felt totally persuaded to leave the church. He started at Willoughby Street, Ebute-Metta, Lagos a
                    housefellowship called, the Glory of God Fellowship. Initially there were nine members but before long
                    the
                    fellowship rapidly grew as the news of the miracles that occurred in their midst spread.

                    Akindayomi also had a vision of words that appeared to be written on a blackboard. The words were “The
                    Redeemed Christian Church of God.” Amazingly, Pa Akindayomi who could not read or write was
                    supernaturally
                    able to write these words down. In this visitation, God also said to him that this church would go to
                    the
                    ends of the earth and that when the Lord Jesus Christ appeared in glory, He would meet the church. The
                    Lord
                    then established a covenant with Pa Akindayomi, synonymous to the Abrahamic covenant in the Bible. He
                    said
                    that He the Lord would meet all the needs of the church in an awesome way if only members would serve
                    Him
                    faithfully and be obedient to His Word. It is upon this covenant that the Redeemed Christian Church of
                    God
                    was built.

                    Thus, the Redeemed Christian Church of God was born in 1952, destined by the Lord Himself to take the
                    world
                    for Him. The church continued to meet at 9 Willoughby Street until they were able to acquire some land
                    thereby witnessing a relocation to the present site of the Headquarters of the church at 1-5 Redemption
                    Way,
                    Ebute-Metta, Lagos (formerly 1a, Cemetery Street).

                    Sometime in the early 70s, God had spoken to Pa Akindayomi about his successor. The Lord told him that
                    this
                    man who was not a member of the church then, would be a young educated man. Thus when a young university
                    lecturer joined the church in 1973, Papa was able to recognize him in the Spirit as the one that the
                    Lord
                    had spoken about in the past. This man, Enoch Adejare Adeboye who was then a lecturer of Mathematics at
                    the
                    University of Lagos soon became involved in the church. He became one of the interpreters translating Pa
                    Akindayomi’s sermons from Yoruba to English. He was ordained a pastor of the church in 1975.

                    Papa was preparing to meet his Creator. He sent for Pastor Adeboye and spent several hours sharing with
                    him
                    details of the covenant and the plans of the Lord for the church. Even though a year before this, the
                    Lord
                    had revealed to Pastor Adeboye that he would be Papa’s successor, it was still too difficult for him to
                    fully contemplate such an awesome responsibility.

                    Pa Josiah Akindayomi was 71 years old when he died. Amidst controversy, Pastor Adeboye’s appointment was
                    formalized by the reading of Pa Akindayomi’s sealed pronouncement after his burial.

                    Since 1981, an open explosion began with the number of parishes growing in leaps and bounds. At the last
                    count, there are at least about 2000 parishes of the Redeemed Christian Church of God in Nigeria. On the
                    International scene, the church is present in other African nations including C’ote D’Ivoire, Ghana,
                    Zambia,
                    Malawi, Zaire, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Gambia, Cameroon, and South Africa. In Europe the church is
                    spread
                    in England, Germany, and France. In the United States there are parishes in Dallas, Tallahassee,
                    Houston,
                    New York, Washington, and Chicago and also in the Caribbean states of Haiti and Jamaica.

                    Today, God is still doing marvelous deeds through the Redeemed Christian Church of God, worldwide. One
                    of
                    the well-known programs of the church is the Holy Ghost Service, an all night miracle service that holds
                    on
                    the first Friday of every month at the Redemption Camp at Km. 46, Lagos-Ibadan expressway. The average
                    headcount of those who attend the Service is about 500,000. The Holy Ghost Service now holds in
                    different
                    parts of the world which includes the United Kingdom, India, USA, Canada, South Africa, Australia,
                    Dubai,
                    Ghana, Philippines and many more

                <p className="underline">Our Vision</p>
                <p>
                    1) To make heaven.
                    <br/>
                    2) To take as many people with us.
                    <br/>
                    3) To have a member of RCCG in every family of all nations.

                    4) To accomplish No. 1 above, holiness will be our lifestyle.
                    <br/>
                    5) To accomplish No. 2 and 3 above, we will plant churches within five minutes walking distance in every

                    developed countries.
                    <br/>
                    6) We will pursue these objectives until every Nation in the world is reached for the Lord Jesus Christ

                <p className="underline">THE BIBLE TEACHING</p>
                <p>
                    We believe that the entire Scripture, both Old and New Testament are written by the inspiration of the
                    Holy Spirit – II Tim. 3:16-17. All the Christian teachings and the Christian attitude of the Children of
                    God are such as are established in the Holy Bible – II Tim. 3:10-15; II Peter 1:21; John 17:17; Ps.
                    119:105.
                    <br />
                    We believe that the Bible is the written and revealed Will of God. Man’s position to God, the way to
                    obtain salvation, woe and destruction awaiting sinners that refuse to repent and everlasting joy that is
                    kept for the born again souls. All the Bible teachings are holy, what the Bible reveals as the will of
                    God are such that we should accept, and whatever God writes in the Bible and His Law are to remain
                    unchangeable; for the Heavens and Earth may pass away but the Word of God stands forever. Deut. 4:22;
                    Rev. 22:18, 19; Matt. 24:34-38.
                </p>
                <p className="underline">ABOUT GOD: Ps. 33:6-9</p>
                <p>
                    As revealed unto us by the Bible, we believe that there is only one God, Who is the Creator of both
                    visible and invisible creatures -Gen. 1:1; Ps. 86:9-10; Is. 43:10-11; John 1:1-3. Only God will be in
                    existence forever. Ez. 3:14; in God every creature receives life -John 5:26.

                <p className="underline">ABOUT JESUS CHRIST</p>
                <p>
                    We believe that He is the Son of God; Who took away our sins, and the Savior of the world. We also
                    believe that Jesus is God and was born by Mary the Virgin. He is God revealed in the flesh. Through Him
                    all things were created. John 1:1-14; John 14:9; Matt. 1:18-25, Is 9:6; Is 53:5-6. We believe in His
                    death on the Cross, and resurrection, by which He brought redemption – Is. 53:4-10; I Pet. 2:24; John
                    10:11; Gal. 3:13, Matt. 20:28; I Cor. 15:3; Rom. 4:25; II Cor. 5:14; Heb 2:9; Heb 9:26.

                <p className="underline">ABOUT THE HOLY SPIRIT</p>
                <p>
                    The Holy Spirit is the third Person in the TRINITY. He has the same power, the same glory with God the
                    Father and God the Son – John 14:16-17; John 15:26; Matt. 3:16; Acts 13:24. He is one with Father and
                    the Son who is to be worshiped and served. Three Persons that become one are the source of blessings to
                    all the living creatures in Heaven and on earth – Matt. 28:19; II Cor. 13:14; I John 1:5-7. The Holy
                    Spirit has a great work to perform. He Teaches, He Speaks to men, and bears witness in us – Acts 16:6-7;
                    He performs the work of regeneration for man- John 3:5-6; He also performs the work of Sanctification in
                    the born again souls until they are fully sanctified – John 16:8; Eph 1:17-19; II Thess. 2:13; I Cor.
                    6:11. This same Holy Spirit endows believers with gifts they can use – I Cor 12:7; He empowers one in
                    the Lord. Acts 1:8.

                <p>
                    The egg is comprised of three parts: The yellow yolk, the whitish part, and the shell. Despite these
                    three (3) substances, the egg is not three but one. Likewise, we believe that God the Father, God the
                    Son, and God the Holy Ghost are one God, but made of three persons – hence they are ONE IN TRINITY –
                    Gen. 1:16-29; Matt. 3:16-17; Matt. 18:19.

                <p>
                    We believe that there is a devil, who seeks the down fall of every man. He brought sickness, sin and
                    death into the world. Gen. 3:1-16. He seeks the destruction of those who exercise their faith in the
                    Lord Jesus. Matt. 4:1-11; James 4:7; I Peter 5:8. The devil has several unclean spirits over whom he
                    governs – Matt. 12:24. A time would soon come when he shall be thrown into the pit and chained for one
                    thousand years- Rev. 20:7-9. After this, he will be put into the lake of fire where he will remain
                    suffering together with his followers for ever and ever. Rev. 20:10

                    the breath of life, and man became a living soul – Gen 2:7. Therefore man is of three parts, namely
                    body, soul and spirit. Man is God’s ambassador on earth to take control over all other creatures on His
